# INT_Capacitative_natural_interface
Capacitative_natural_interface is an interactive project that allows the user to produce and modulate sounds by simply touching house plants or other natural elements.

"I believe in God, only I spell it Nature." <br/>
Frank Lloyd Wright

Within this system, the touch of the user produces a variation in the electrical continuity wich is capted by capacitative sensors and trasmitted to a micro-controller and then to the computer. In the computer, the sound coming from an external or pre-recorded source is generatively modulated according to the chosen algorithm. A visualization of the data coming from the sensors was then realized within software.
